## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was the first time translating a professional level multipage Figma design into a full implementation and while it went decent, it has showed me areas I can improve. For example, starting the project by translating the design system into modular tailwind configurations and/or css classes seems a worthwhile investment before starting any components.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/pixel-perfection/) - This helped me understand the disconnect between mockups and implementations. I really liked this article conveying the small tweaks that lead to more ideal representations of design mockups and will use it going forward. I'd recommend to anyone getting started with front end development.
